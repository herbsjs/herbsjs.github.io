## Introduction to Herbs

Herbs helps you build backend applications faster and adds more value for your domain and business logic. You can find out more about it here [What's Herbs?](/docs/introduction/whats-herbs)

If you don't want to see a step-by-step tutorial but an application running with Herbs, you can visit our [Getting Started](/docs) section.

To help with setup process, Herbs has a [`herbs-cli`](https://github.com/herbsjs/herbs-cli) which starts up a new project scaffolding.

In this tutorial, we are going to walk through all Herbs features by building a User application.

## What to Expect

- You will learn Herbs architectural concepts
- 2 entities
- 3 use cases
- Database access and Repositories
- GraphQL Types, Mutations and Queries
- Documentation with Herbs Shelf

## Requirements

- You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed into your machine with LTS version

## Project Setup

You will learn how to use Herbs with hebs-cli or manually. But we strongly recommend that you use our [`herbs-cli`](https://github.com/herbsjs/herbs-cli)

### With herbs-cli

1. Install [`herbs-cli`](https://github.com/herbsjs/herbs-cli) globally:

```sh
npm i -g @herbsjs/herbs-cli 
```

2. Create a new project using it:

```sh
herbs new
```

3. Answer the questions and create the project:

The folder structure generated by the CLI is as follows:

```sh

### Manually

You can also set up the file by your own. To help you on that, we have an [extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EndersonCosta.herbs-snippets) with code snippets and templates.
